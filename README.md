# Quarterly S&P 500 Return Probabilities: A Bayesian Approach
![DALLE Markov Sampling](./resources/DALLE_Markov_Sampling.webp)
## Summary
This Python script leverages **PyMC 5.10** and **ArviZ** to forecast the probabilities of quarterly S&P 500 returns falling within specific ranges using a Bayesian Linear Regression model. Developed with the assistance of **Chat GPT** and **GitHub Copilot**, it marries Bayesian statistical methods with advanced visualization techniques to provide insightful forecasts on financial market trends.

## Key Components

### Data Preparation and Analysis
- Loads and processes monthly data on the S&P 500, VIX, and interest rates, converting it to a quarterly format.
- Calculates logarithmic returns for the S&P 500, along with changes in the VIX and interest rates.
- Introduces lagged features to enhance forecast accuracy by incorporating historical data.

### Feature Engineering and Model Training
- Selects influential features for modeling S&P 500 returns.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets, applying RobustScaler to mitigate outlier impacts.
- Utilizes robust scaling to ensure model accuracy and resilience.

### Bayesian Modeling and Iterative Prediction
- Employs a Bayesian Linear Regression model with Student's t-distribution errors, specifying priors and utilizing MCMC sampling for posterior estimation.
- Refines predictions each quarter by updating the model with new data, improving forecast precision over time.
- Calculates predictive probabilities for specified ranges of S&P 500 returns, offering actionable insights.

### Visualization and Performance Evaluation
- Visualizes MCMC trace plots and posterior predictive distributions for model transparency.
- Compares model predictions against actual returns to assess forecast accuracy.

### Results Compilation and Analysis
- Compiles predicted probabilities and actual returns for comprehensive performance analysis.
- Implements a function to evaluate the model's predictive effectiveness based on the highest probability ranges.

## Future Directions
This foundational model highlights the potential of Bayesian methods in financial forecasting. It's a starting point for further enhancements, such as advanced feature engineering and rigorous testing of prediction fits, aimed at improving model accuracy and insights for financial decision-making processes.
